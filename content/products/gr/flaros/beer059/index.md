Our handcrafted recipe boasts one of our favourite hop varieties. Mosaic shows off its unique hoppy character at 35 IBU, intertwined with the distinct malty caramel notes to reveal this luscious American amber ale. What to expect: orange, hints of grapefruit peel, marmalade, passion fruit and tropical fruit tones. What more would you ask for? Taste the unexpected.
