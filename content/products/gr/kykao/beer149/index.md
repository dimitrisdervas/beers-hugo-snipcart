American Pale Ale is the closest we will get to balance! With 6% alcohol this brew has actual malt backbone and most of the trademark C-hops of Yakima valley! 

Centennial, Chinook, Cascade, Columbus and Citra add citrusy and light tropical fruit aromas with a bitterness that is closer to an American IPA. This is our interpretation of American Pale Ale, interesting, bold and complex!
