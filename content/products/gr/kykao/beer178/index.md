An English Export Stout with a Greek twist in it!

During the whirlpool we added the peel of a traditional Greek tangerine variety &quot;Citrus deliciose tenore&quot;! It is a tangerine variety full of seeds but with an aroma that&#39;s out of this world!

The light citrussy and fruity notes of the tangerine add a contrasting note to the the heavy roasted chocolate and burnt aromas of the 8% Export Stout!
