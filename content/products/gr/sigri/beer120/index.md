Sigri Brewery is an independent beer production Company in Lesvos, which implements unique brewing techniques to produce a home crafted and specially flavoured beer. Inspired by Lesvos’s hedonistic heritage and led by deep experimental intentions, we believe our beer is characterized by the highest quality ingredients as well as the exclusiveness of its flavour.
