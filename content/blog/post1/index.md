The piña colada may not be an everyday drink (or something to drink too much of; there's a lot of sugar in them after all). But for those occasions when you're feeling festive—especially if that festivity should be accompanied by warm weather—the classic PC is tough to beat.

t's frosty, it's coconut-y—hell, there's a reason you ordered virgin versions of this drink as a kid. And while it may take a bit more effort to make than your basic cocktail, it's actually not all that difficult. All you need are the right ingredients and a good blender. And maybe some tropical island rhythms to guide you along the way.

Ingredients

2 1/2 oz. rum
3 oz. pineapple juice
1 oz. coconut cream
ice
Collins glass
Directions

Start with the rum (Puerto Rican, Dominican, or Cuban are best, though truth be told, we prefer ours with a more romantic-tasting añejo, such as Brugal or the Bacardi 8). Then combine with unsweetened pineapple juice (you can sub in 3 ounces crushed or whole pineapple), and coconut cream (not coconut juice or milk; you want the sweetened stuff with the chemicals—Coco Lopez is traditional) in a blender.

Blend on high with a cup or so of crushed ice or 5 or 6 ice cubes (add them 1 or 2 at a time, through the hole in the lid).

Pour into a tall glass. Garnish with whatever you've got. Cherry. Pineapple. Fruit. For extra eye-appeal, pour 1/2 ounce Cherry Heering in over the back of a spoon and watch it swirl.
