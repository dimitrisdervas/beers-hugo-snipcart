title: "Colonial Brewing Co. Draught"
body_html: >
    It's draught, but not as you know it. Think German noble hops and malt. Think perfect carbonation. Think refreshing on a scorching summer day and tasty on a cold winter one. Our mission was simple: to create a beer that's perfect for those times when you feel like a beer - because the sun is shining, it’s the weekend, or because it’s day time, or night time.
