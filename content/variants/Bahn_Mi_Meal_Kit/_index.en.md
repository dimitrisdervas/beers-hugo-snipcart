For those uninitiated into the Banh Mi fan club, think sub sandwich with a Vietnamese twist. Banh Mi are one of our favourite street-food treats because once you’ve got your flavour trinity of sweet, sour and savoury covered, the sky is truly the limit. In this mouth-watering version, we’re whipping up ground pork patties seasoned with fresh cilantro, lime and garlic.
