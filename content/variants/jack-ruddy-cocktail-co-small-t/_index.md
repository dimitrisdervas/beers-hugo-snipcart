This Small Batch Tonic is essentially a quinine concentrate. It's designed to pair with your favorite Gin or Vodka, and is then stretched with soda water to make a bright, light, refreshing highball.

With a backbone of quinine, culled from the Cinchona Tree, we've added a delicate mix of botanicals, and then sweetened it with real cane sugar; the final product is a complex mixture that introduces a fine bitterness to any cocktail, and a great pairing with the botanicals of the finest Gins in the world.
