En - Cook's Magazine raved about it. We do, too. This is olive oil the way it's meant to be. Nuñez de Prado is an award-winning, organic, handcrafted olive oil from Spain that you'll want to buy in multiples, to keep on hand and to give as gifts. A full-flavored and fruity blend with hints of grassiness, almonds and butter, this oil finishes with oranges and peppers — a near-spellbinding flavor which leaves a pleasant and long lasting aftertaste.
